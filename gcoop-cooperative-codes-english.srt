00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:11,000
Gcoop presents

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,400
cooperative codes

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Computer programs have permeated our life,

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,200
that is to say, software

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,870
Software is the name given to an idea or to a collection of ideas that let the operation of machinery

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,200
cell phones, cameras, planes, and traffic lights.

8
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:35,660
Today, people's ideas which make machines function are sold everywhere.

9
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:42,000
Actually, here we can see an average human being

10
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:45,100
in this case, a woman.

11
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:48,715
She's sending a text message through her phone.

12
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:52,000
She's just purchased proprietary software to print some ideas as instructed by her boss.

13
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,543
She should be happy.

14
00:00:57,476 --> 00:01:00,511
But, how can someone pack an idea in a box and be able to sell it?

15
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,062
An idea is a form or an aspect that occurres to somebody.

16
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:07,000
That is to say, it's something immaterial.

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,610
To be able to show an idea and to offer it, it's necessary to make it material.

18
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,350
We illustrate it with a drawing of this light bulb next to our friend

19
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:17,176
the Average Woman

20
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:21,400
The light bulb is an invention that Thomas Alva Edison patented in 1880.

21
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:24,850
But the idea had already been put forward by Humphry Davy

22
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:27,000
and previously, by Warren De La Rue.

23
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:33,000
That is to say, Edison patented an idea that took various forms starting from the exchange of knowledge.

24
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:38,600
It isn't necessary for an idea to turn into something palpable to become a material object.

25
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,000
Far back in time, humans developed language,

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,100
which is the matter that allows them to represent their ideas.

27
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:51,500
Language enables humans to relate in a different way with nature in comparison to the way animals do it.

28
00:01:52,168 --> 00:01:54,800
Language permits culture to exist,

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:01,000
that is to say, all this exchange of ideas enables man to interact and cooperate in a community

30
00:02:02,614 --> 00:02:05,200
The Average Woman belongs to the western culture.

31
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:11,100
In the origin of this culture, people used to exchange their ideas within assemblies and public open spaces.

32
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:14,500
Unfortunately, today public spaces have bars

33
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,300
and ideas cannot be exchanged so freely.

34
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:18,600
Let's see.

35
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:24,400
For software to be able to be a material object, somebody must have thought an idea and have written it.

36
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:27,100
That is to say, software is a script.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,100
The ones who write the ideas that become software are called developers or programmers.

38
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:35,500
Acturally, here we have a programmer.

39
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:40,700
At this moment, the good old programmer is developing an idea by using the script,

40
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:43,700
but in a strange language that only machines can understand...

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,100
and the programmers

42
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:49,300
This strange language is also written in a computer

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,000
and it is arranged in a certain way so as to have the machine do what one wants it to do.

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,000
We call those scripts Source Code.

45
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,650
The good old programmer has had the idea of developing a different colour light bulb,

46
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:01,000
completely free.

47
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:09,100
Like an idea that travels through language,

48
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,750
programs have the possibility of being copied, reinterpreted,

49
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,800
added, reinvented and transmitted again.

50
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:24,000
To depirve software of its collective spirit is to deprive humans of the exchange of ideas,

51
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:26,500
that is to say, to deprive them of their culture.

52
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:29,300
It's like putting a light bulb behind a window

53
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:32,000
or to lock up a person in a public square.

54
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:36,000
But, let's talk to a specialist who can explain these ideas to us.

55
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:38,100
This is a specialist.

56
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:44,000
Proprietary software basically differs from free software on freedom conferred to the users.

57
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,100
Free software allows the user

58
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,100
to learn from the program, modify it...

59
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:55,500
redistribute it, whereas proprietary software can only let people use it with some restrictions.

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,200
and it is always tied to the company that created it

61
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:00,000
Thank you, specialist.

62
00:04:00,278 --> 00:04:03,000
But, how did we get to the proprietary software?

63
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:04,300
Very simple.

64
00:04:04,464 --> 00:04:10,100
Proprietary software companies take the good old programmer's idea and hide the "source code."

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,700
They take the most restrictive form under the laws of intelectual property that they indeed have them promulgated:

66
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:18,500
"All rights reserved."

67
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:25,300
This way, the only thing that our friend can hopefully do is to use the program.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,550
Here there is a samll trap.

69
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:28,950
Intelectual property

70
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:33,900
is fundamentally based on the idea that an author is that person who creates an original unprecedented work.

71
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:37,400
However, the word "author" comes from the Latin word "auctor",

72
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,700
which, in turn, comes from "augere": which means increase, to advance.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,100
That is to say, an author doesn't invent anything

74
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:47,300
they only improve something that already existed.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,200
In 1883, world leaders sign the Paris Convention,

76
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:56,200
which legally recognizes intelectual property and allows export of ideas.

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,750
Of course, in 1883 software was not as we know it today.

78
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's talk to another specialist in order for him to update us.

79
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:07,650
Software is born with computers in the 50s.

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:15,600
Software transforms into a commodity and it starts to be limited in such a way as not to be

81
00:05:15,763 --> 00:05:21,550
... an available element say as public knowlegde can be.

82
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:28,000
on the basis of letting increasingly monopolistic companies to develop.

83
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,000
Uh-huh... But what does that mean on the good old programmer daily basis?

84
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:36,100
There is a constant reduction in the cost of development,

85
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:41,500
It is said that from the price of software, about 5% is

86
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,000
what the programmer indeed earns

87
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,700
whereas the owner of the product receives the rest who has in some way

88
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,700
the ownership of the source code, of that intelectual property.

89
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:56,080
Crystal clear.

90
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,150
That is to say: if the good old programmer worked for a transnational proprietary software company

91
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,200
he/she would only earn the 5% of what it costs to pack his/her idea and sell it.

92
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:09,800
Our Average Woman has been a victim of advertising and she has wanted this package.

93
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,700
Let's see how she is doing.

94
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:15,600
She's installing her proprietary software and she seems happy.

95
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:19,600
Argh! It has what you call a pretty environment image.

96
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh Oh, it seems that something doesn't work well.

97
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:30,000
The package didn't say that the printer wasn't compatible with the program.

98
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:37,600
She'll have to buy another printer.

99
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,500
Her boss has demanded her ideas in order for the company, where she works, be able to continue profiting.

100
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:50,000
Now it seems that she will be able to print her ideas and take them to her boss.

101
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:56,000
Oops, it seems that something doesn't work well.

102
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,100
The antivirus needs another update to scan the new printer.

103
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:05,000
That is to say, she needs to buy another proprietary software and to pay for another license.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Do not worry, friend.

105
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:12,350
We know that almost everything is horrible, but not all software is proprietary,

106
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:15,100
and not all companies aim at stamping out your money.

107
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:19,800
The good old programmer hasn't been hired by a transnational,

108
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,600
he decided to organise a free software cooperative.

109
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,160
In a cooperative, the members meet to cooperate.

110
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:31,000
To cooperate is to act jointly with others for a common goal.

111
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,000
This is a cooperative.

112
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:38,000
The good old programmer says that a for-profit enterprise is organised in a hierarchical way

113
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,500
and the decisions are taken by the capitalist.

114
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,000
On the other hand, a cooperative is organized in a horizontal way and each member represents a vote.

115
00:07:46,452 --> 00:07:49,500
That is to say, decisions are taken in assembly.

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,700
The development model of a proprietary software company is closed,

117
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:59,140
the organizational structure is pyramidal,

118
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,680
it depends on a boss, "those who can't do, teach"

119
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,500
Basically, the one who has to do the tasks,

120
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:06,600
the workers,

121
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,600
work in a rush, because everything has to be done for tomorrow or for yesterday

122
00:08:09,808 --> 00:08:13,728
they are the last ones to find out about changes.It happens the same to our friend.

123
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:20,950
On the contrary, cooperative model garanties equal participation in decision making and doing the work.

124
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,000
And this is the best model in line with free software development.

125
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,100
By the way, how is work organized in a cooperative?

126
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:31,500
This specialist can help us.

127
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:36,400
Generally speaking, in the capitalist system we have two kinds of companies,

128
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:39,900
limited liability companies and partnerships,

129
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:46,200
in the particular case of cooperatives, like work cooperatives where I belong to

130
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,100
it's an enterprise, where the worker finds work for themselves

131
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:57,100
and work leads and it's subordinated to capital, in liability companies it's the other way around.

132
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Crystal clear.

133
00:08:58,423 --> 00:09:04,000
Now, since you're a specialist, could you sum up the origin of capital and capitalism in twenty seconds?

134
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,550
No..., indeed, I couldn't...

135
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:08,500
Ok, it's alright, we'll have to do it.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,500
Capitalism is the economic and political system which has got two main elements:

137
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:21,000
capital (the resources that are available to produce something) and the capitalist (possesses the resources and earns the profit).

138
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:24,000
But a worker is also necessary.

139
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,300
The Average Woman or a programmer are typical examples of a worker.

140
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,800
Our friend, due to the company where she works, she's already undermining her co-workers jobs.

141
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:39,600
Most of the people in the world haven't got goods to sell in the market and make a profit.

142
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,400
That's why what they sell is their work force.

143
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:47,600
Work force is the capacity of every person to produce something.

144
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,300
A person sells it for some hours, the capitalist gives them money.

145
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:54,200
We call that money salary.

146
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:59,700
In the salary, the capitalist saves part of what costs the work force and keeps the money for himself.

147
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:04,600
That saving is called profit or exploitation of workers.

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The Average Woman, who is a worker and had to buy her program from a for-profit enterprise,

149
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,000
has part of her salary taken away

150
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,700
and she has spent part of her salary in buying proprietary software,

151
00:10:16,813 --> 00:10:21,000
a new printer and, besides, she'll have to buy another antivirus software.

152
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:25,300
Let's ask another specialist if he agrees with our summary about capitalism.

153
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:28,400
Mmmmmm....

154
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:34,000
Excellent. Now, tell us, how does cooperativism appear in Argentina?

155
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:42,300
At the end of the XIX century, there is a big immigration in the nation and those immigrants find out that they have got

156
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,700
absolutely nothing, nor where to go.

157
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:50,650
And they started to outline different forms of organising among themselves,

158
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:53,656
so as to give a hand to each other in everything that they needed,

159
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:58,000
in such a way that, the first cooperative organizations

160
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,827
started to appear in the nation.

161
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,100
Thank you, specialist.

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,400
Many times, cooperatives are out of our sight.

163
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:10,000
Hey, psst, psst, not there!

164
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Correct, there.

165
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,500
There are different ways of classifing cooperatives.

166
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,350
Among them, we find the work cooperatives,

167
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:25,500
which are associations of people gathered with the aim of improving their social and economical situation.

168
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,800
In a work cooperative of free software there are workers who think of ideas and develop their culture.

169
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,500
But, how does a cooperative work daily?

170
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,900
Let's talk with a member of gcoop

171
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:39,400
This is a member.

172
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,650
A memeber is a person who works jointly with other people to develop an activity,

173
00:11:44,818 --> 00:11:47,200
whether it be business, social, or cultural.

174
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:52,400
We don't sell little boxes, nor we sell licenses, but...

175
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,500
... we sell the sevicies associated with software, that is the adaptation, the implementation...

176
00:11:57,793 --> 00:12:02,650
and the training to use a specific software that solves a problem of an organization.

177
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,800
We get paid, for the associated services, for our work,

178
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:09,900
that is to say we get paid once and we do the job once,

179
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:13,700
in the other model you do the job once, and you get paid for ever.

180
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:15,100
Let's ask the programmer

181
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,700
why people think that they can have bigger problems

182
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,000
using free software than using proprietary software.

183
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:23,400
There are no software that hasn't got mistakes

184
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,200
the difference is that regarding proprietary software,

185
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:32,000
one doesn't see the mistakes and there is a whole marketing campaign that says "this one works, it works perfectly."

186
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:36,500
In free software, we are open-minded and we say "these are the mistakes, we'll correct them."

187
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,700
By the way, how can free software help our friend with her problem?

188
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,400
Well, she can hire a programmer to solve that problem,

189
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,500
here is where I do my part, modifying...

190
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:54,400
...the program so it does what my friend needs it to do. It's in line with the social economic model.

191
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,200
What do you mean?

192
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,500
Free software is social economy,

193
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,500
because it creates local jobs and, as a result, money of the nation stays in the nation.

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,300
Self-management has the power of taking decisions as opposed to what, some time ago, used to be incumbent on the owners of companies.

195
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
Boss,#**#*** I resign.

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,700
Well done, friend.

197
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
And no fear for your decisions,

198
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
the software cooperatives of the nation...

199
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,700
have gathered in the Argentine Federation Cooperatives of Work of Technology, Innovation and Knowledge

200
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:32,000
(FACTTIC)

201
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,750
and they'll never leave you alone.

202
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,000
Using software should become a more conscious act.

203
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:44,200
Companies that sell ideas justify their prices by making us believe that software is a huge industry.

204
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:49,500
And our friend has already proved that it's only about the packaging of free ideas.

205
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:54,500
Proprietary software is based on the original idea that cannot be copied.

206
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:56,800
Originality doesn't exist.

207
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,000
Humanity exists...

208
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,300
and humanity, as far as we know...

209
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,900
it feeds itself on culture and advances due to culture by exchanges and rewrites.

210
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:09,400
Our friend has learned that every software is free by itself...

211
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,600
and, if she wants to print and spread freely her ideas

212
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,200
she can do it better and more affordable through it.

213
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
But she knows more.

214
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:25,200
She has learned that working in a collective and pleasant manner brings benefits

215
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:29,550
not only economical, but also social for the rest of humankind

216
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Our friend is no longer an average human being and she's becoming...

217
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,100
a model cooperativist.

218
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:41,200
